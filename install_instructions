I copied this from a slack thread, so it's not pretty

Install python3 and mysql (google is your friend)

clone the standupinator script here:
https://github.com/nullxix/standupinator
then paste the following lovely piece of bash code in either
~/.bash_profile or
~/.zsh
(depending on which already exists)
function standup(){
  pushd /path/to/install/dir
  python3 cli.py "$@"
  popd
}
export -f standup
change /path/to/install/dir to the path-name to wherever you cloned the standupinator script
for me, that was ~/dev/standupinator (edited)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THEN, you'll want to copy+paste this other  thing into a terminal somewhere
  |        |         |
 V       V       V
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib mysql argparse

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THEN you'll go to where you cloned the standupinator repo
find a file names env_example.py copy that to a new file called
env.py and then just kinda fill in the file (it's basically the same as a .env file, you put your mysql user / password)
the mysql host is probably localhost
the spreadsheet_id is 1Ikx7VcpKiYnlU6D-_86jpBFyF6zEu_SBe5Gf5f9zFQk
the sheet_tab_name is "Student Standups"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the database name? You're gonna have to create it.
in your terminal
mysql -u <username>
if you gave it a password
mysql -u <username> -p
if the username/password is the same as your computer username/password, you can usually just go
mysql
Now you're in mysql!
create database <database-name>;
exit;
the semi-colons are very important
Simple 5 step process. Send me your error messages because I definitely missed something. If you venmo me $13.27 I'll write an auto-install script that does all that for you
If you get through everything alive, type
standup --init
to finish the installation (edited)
All of this only works after mysql and python3 are installed
Good luck, have fun!
